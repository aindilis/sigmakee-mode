<center><font size="+3"><ul>A DAML Mode for XEmacs and GNU Emacs</ul></font></center>

This is the beta release of the DAML mode for the Emacs editor. 
For more information about the DAML language
and the semantic web see 
<a href="http://www.daml.org">The DAML Program Web Site</a>.<p>

Anyone who has tried to write DAML ontologies in a text editor will
recognize that it requires a lot of typing, and that reading and moving
around in such files can be tedious. This is (hopefully) a step in the direction of
addressing those problems.  DAML-EMACS is a "mode" for use with the EMACS
text editor, not unlike the modes for C++, Java, LateX, LISP and HTML... that
existed previously. It provides automatic fontification to make the code easier to read, 
commands to insert new forms to be filled out, and keyboard commands for moving about the file 
in logical DAML/RDF or XML units.

This current release is was developed for XEmacs version 21.1, but is being adapted to 
also work with GNU Emacs (versions from 19.28 up). It has been tested with GNU version 20, 
and works acceptably there, as long as you have a recent version of the W3 package for Emacs. 
<p>
We recommend using XEmacs with DAML mode over GNU Emacs. It 
is faster and the fonts are much better. The W3 mode version mentioned above works
with XEmacs as well, although the version available 
from <a href="http://www.xemacs.org">http://www.xemacs.org</a> is also fine. 
<p>
If you need/want to install XEmacs on a windows platform, 
there are two installation sets for version 21.4.3 available at
<a href="http://www.xemacs.org">http://www.xemacs.org</a>, 
and they are also downloadable from here:

<ul>
<li> A version for use in conjunction with Cygwin (a unix-like shell that runs in Windows): 
<a href="http://openmap.bbn.com/~burstein/daml-emacs/xemacs-i686-pc-cygwin-21.4.3.tar.gz">
Download non-CYGWIN XEmacs.</a>.</li>
<li>
A version for use without Cygwin:
<a href="http://openmap.bbn.com/~burstein/daml-emacs/xemacs-i586-pc-win32-21.4.3.tar.gz">Download CYGWIN XEmacs.</a>
</ul>
<p>
When you install either of these, and try to run it for the first time, 
it will try to create an init file based on your prior GNU ~/.emacs
file if one exits. You can avoid some confusion here by first creating
the ~/.xemacs/init.el file with nothing in it, and then moving things 
over from your .emacs initialization file gradually. 
<p>
DAML mode the emacs W3 package to access web pages.  The W3 mode 
version 4.0 installation tar from the University of Indiana, but you can also just
<a href="http://openmap.bbn.com/~burstein/daml-emacs/w3-4.tar.gz">Download W3 mode</a> from here.<p>
After unpacking it, see the file INSTALL for a installation on UNIX or 
the README.NT for windows installation.

The beta release source code for DAML mode is downloadable from this tar file: 
<a href="http://openmap.bbn.com/~burstein/daml-emacs/daml-emacs-beta.tar">daml-emacs-beta.tar</a> 
<p>


<ol>
<li>
Unpack the files into a directory named daml/ somewhere, such as
~/emacs/daml</li>
<li> Edit your ~/.emacs (GNU or UNIX XEmacs) or ~/.xemacs/init.el
(windows XEmacs) initialization file so that the load-path includes
the ~/emacs/daml/ (or wherever you put them) directory, and the directory containing the w3 package
(for xemacs this is already there)..
</li>
<li> (optional) Compile the .el files in this directory. This seems to make the 
most difference for GNU emacs. To do it, in emacs do the following commands:
<ol>
<li>M-x cd  (at the prompt enter the code directory, e.g. "~/emacs/daml")</li>
<li>M-x load-file  (at the prompt enter "docomp")</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

To fix the load path (2 above), add the following two lines to the initialization file:
<p>
<code>
(setq <tab ID="tab1">load-path <br>
&#09;<tab TO="tab1">(append <tab ID="tab2">'(<tab ID="tab3">"<i>&lt;path to the emacs code directory&gt;</i>/daml/"
"<i>&lt;path to w3 directory&gt;</i>") 
<br><tab to="tab2">load-path))<br>
(load "damlite")<br>
</code>
<p>
The w3 path is needed only if installing it yourself for use with GNU Emacs.

<center><font size="+2">Using DAML Mode</font></center><p>
See the README with the distribution for more details. <p>
Once daml mode is installed, just open or create a file with extension .daml or edit any file
and do<br> <center><code>M-x DAML-MODE</code></center><br>
If you open a non-existent file, like "newfile.daml", some default header information
plus the rdf:RDF and /rdf:RDF tags are inserted. See 'daml-helper-new-buffer-template' in
the file damlite.el to change what this looks like.
<p>
To get full use DAML-MODE, you will have to ascertain that the W3 package is
installed on your machine, and that the load path makes it accessible. If it is not installed, 
you will not be able to use M-. to find DAML definitions on the web.
To see if it is installed do<br>
<center> <code>M-x locate-library (ENTER) w3 (ENTER)</code></center><p>

If already installed, you will probably find 
it as a subdirectory under the XEmacs installation directory called<br>
<code> ...mumble.../lisp/w3/</code>
<p> If you can't find it, you will have to install it.
A copy of the tar'd (and gzipped) source for this package is available from 
<a href="http://www.xemacs.org/Download/optLibs.html">http://www.xemacs.org/Download/optLibs.html</a> or you can just
<a href="http://openmap.bbn.com/~burstein/daml-emacs/w3-1.20-pkg.tar.gz">Download W3 Mode from here</a>.
<p>

<hr>
<center><font size="+2">Patches</font></center>
I will occasionally update the source code, as bugs are discovered. I will keep 
copies of each of the .el files in the  <a href="http://openmap.bbn.com/~burstein/daml-emacs/patches">patch directory.</a> 
as they change so that individual files can be 
retrieved instead of a full distribution. If you downloaded a pre-beta version I recommend you 
just get the tar file. 

Here are recent updates:

<ul>
<li> 2-18-02 - (replaced tar file)  Made motion commands save mark. Added many new insert DAML form commands, moved all inserts to a separate menu.</li>
</ul>
